solution using FD solver is 640 times faster than the plain tower.

Ambiguous Puzzle:

ambiguous(5,C,T1,T2).

C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[1,3,2,3,2],[5,3,2,3,1],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[3,4,5,1,2],[5,3,1,2,4]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[2,4,5,1,3],[5,3,1,2,4]]
